Certain modules, such as CGI::Ajax and JavaScript::Autocomplete::Backend,
require a minimal CGI.pm-compatible module to provide, in particular,
param() and header() methods to, respectively, fetch parameters
and to set the headers. The standard module to
do this is of course CGI.pm; however, especially in a mod_perl
environment, there may be concerns with the resultant memory footprint.
This module provides param() and header() methods via
mod_perl2 and librapreq2, and as such, it may be a viable
alternative in a mod_perl scenario. However, due to the nature of
the required APR modules needed here, this module may also be used
in a CGI environment. See the documentation for
CGI::Apache2::Wrapper for details.

Installation proceeds through the usual
   perl Makefile.PL
   $MAKE
   $MAKE test
   $MAKE install
or, if Module::Build is available,
   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install
A ppm package for Win32 users of ActivePerl 8xx can be installed
by adding http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/ to your list
of repositories and then issuing the command
   C:\> ppm install CGI-Apache2-Wrapper
